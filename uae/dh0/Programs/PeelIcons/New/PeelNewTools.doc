NEW IN THIS VERSION

Neat graphical user interface by Michael Hartmann
Multiple file select.
Bugfixes



DESCRIPTION

This little program removes NewIcon tooltypes from your icons and
thereby makes them load twice as fast. It is intended on people like
me who don't run NewIcon, and have slow systems.

What it really does is searching for tooltypes that starts with IM1=,
IM2=, or empty strings, and removes them. It also removes the
statement: " *** DON'T EDIT THE FOLLOWING LINES!! *** ".

To speed up the workbench even more, replace your old icons with the
small ones in the icon directory. They are smaller than the originals,
and loads faster.

WARNING:

PeelNewTools removes all NewIcon information from the icons. If you
plan to use NewIcons in the future, you should probably not run
PeelNewTools on your disks.



DISCLAMER

DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT.
DO NOT BLAME ME.



USAGE

PeelNewTools FileNames/A/M [R=Recursive] [L=Log]


  FileNames:  Names of files/directories to process.

  Recursive: Set this switch if you want to peel all files in the subpaths of
             <Filename>.
             NB! <Filename>.info is not searched.

  Log:       Outputs a lists of the files that are operated.



GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE

The GUI is made by Michael Hartmann. Very easy to use. Click on icon,
select single or multiple mode, then select file/drawer to operate on.

To make it work, PeelNewTools and PeelNewTools_GUI must be in the same
directory. The script uses IconX, Requestchoise and Requestfile which
must be in C:.



ICON REPLACEMENT

In the "Icons" directory are smaller versions of some icons. Yes, I
know they are pretty boring, but I haven't got much of artistic
inspiration. Replace your old icons with them, and the windows will
take up less space, and the icons will update faster.

WARNING!!! DO NOT EVER COPY THE NEW ICONS OVER THE OLD ONES. 
That would delete important information for the files, like tooltypes
and defaulttool.

Instead use a program that only replaces the images, like IconUpdate
which can be found on Aminet



BUGS

None yet.

If you find any, tell me (try to be as specific as you can). The
source is included, so you are welcome to fix the bugs by yourself,
but tell me anyway.

FUTURE PLANS

I'm thinking of patching the GetDiskObject() librarycall to pop up a
requester whenever NewIcon-tooltypes are discovered.

If you find bugs, tell me. If you enhance the program, or have ideas,
tell me and give me a copy of the code.
