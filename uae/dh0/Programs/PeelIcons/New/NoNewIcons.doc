 NoNewIcons 1.0 (c) by Marcel Doering 1996 (20-March-1996)

 Q: What is this little tool ?

 A: This little tool will recursively search all
    directorys on your Disks or Harddisks for
    'NewIcons'.

 Maybe you know these Icons, it`s an quite good
 idea, but when you want to remove all of them,
 you have to use 'KillNewIcon' on every icon,
 that`s why I wrote this little program.

 It will recursively look for icons and then
 kills the 'NewIcon-Tooltypes' and only these !

 Well, simply start it, you don`t need more
 docs to run it.

 What it needs:

 SYS:System/Rexxmast should be active !

 RexxReqTools.library should be in your libs:
 assign (or path).

 You need the triton and tritonrexx.library in your
 libs: assign. (included)

 You also need the little program 'KillNewIcon' in
 your c: assign. (also included)

 About 1 Meg of free mem.

 That`s all.
