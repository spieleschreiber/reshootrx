.description
PicCon is a program to aid developers of Amiga software for including
graphical images in their own programs.\n\n
In a full featured GUI you are able to cut out any portion of a loaded
picture and save it back to disk in a variety of formats. Supported formats
include: ordinary bitplanes, interleaved bitplanes, chunkypixels,
blittermasks, Amiga sprites, IFF ILBMs, workbench icons,
Super Nintendo/Famicom and Sega Megadrive/Genesis charactersets and lots
of variations on these main formats.\n
You can also save the picture's palette in a variety of formats, including
ordinary raw 4, 8, or 32 bits-per-gun, Amiga copperlists, IFF ILBM and more.\n
All saves can be done in either binary, as linkmodules (objectfiles), or in
sourcecode (assembler, C, E or Pascal).\n\n
The pictures which contain your images can be stored in IFF ILBM or any
format you've got datatypes' support for as the datatypes.library supplied
with OS3.0 is used (if present) by PicCon. RAW images and workbench icons
can also be loaded (for e.g. reediting), and PicCon also supports loading
and handling of standard IFF ANIMs.\n\n
Some simple (but, in this context, useful) imageprocessing tools have been
included in PicCon, like pen remapping, palette compression, size and depth
scaling and palette fitting. Other features that have proved very handy for
time-saving purposes are the "gridsave", "autocrop" and "autoscan" functions.
The "autoscan" function makes it possible to process a whole picture full
of images in one operation. The "gridsave" feature lets you save hundreds
of e.g. maptiles for backgroundgraphics in a game in a single command.\n\n
