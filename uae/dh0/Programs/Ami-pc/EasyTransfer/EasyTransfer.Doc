Here is a quick and dirty doc for EasyTransfer:

 EasyTransfer uses a 3 wire serial connection (see end of file) to transfer 
files between Amiga and IBM compatibles. To use it, you should first transfer
the EasyPC.exe program to an IBM machine. You can use programs like CrossDOS
to do this. Run the EasyPC there. The program uses serial port 2 by 
default, because many people use port 1 for mouse. Yot can ask the use
of port 1 by using the '-1' command line option. option -2 is equivalent
to default. The program shows a screen full of 'IBM' texts and gradually
replaces them with 'AMIGA!'. if you specify '-v' or '-V' as command line
options, the program shows messages indicating its workings. You can quit
the server program any time by pressing Control-break.

Example: If you want to use serial port number 1 and also want to see
what the program is doing, enter this command:  C:\> EasyPC -1 -v

 The Amiga program controles the whole scene. It opens a screen showing
two windows. The right one is for Amiga files, the left one shows server
directories.

 You start the session by first running the server on the PC. Then run the
Amiga program. There is a 'CONFIG' gagdet in lower right of the screen,
pressing it opens a configuration window in which you can enter the name
of the serial device to use , serial device unit (if you have multiple 
serial ports), a delay time which specifies how much the server and Amiga 
should wait for a reply, a starting speed (more on this later) and the 
method of hardware access on the PC, you can specify 'BIOS' to use BIOS 
calls in serial port programming. This should be more compatible but limits 
the maximum speed at 9600 bps. it can be used for example on PC emulators 
on other computers. By choosing 'DIRECTLY', the upper limit of serial 
transfer becomes 115200. The program can periodically check the cable
connecting the machines, Enter a 0 here to prevent the check. Also,
you can determine how many times the program should retransmit the 
information if it gets corrupted.


 The program determines the speed to use by choosing the speed in the 
configuration window written under the name of starting speed. Then the
Amiga and PC send each other packets of data at the specified speed and 
check to see if the information was received intact. If successfull, the 
speed is used, otherwise a lower speed is chosen and the whole thing
is repeated. The method chosen in the program has some bugs and It
is possible for the Amiga and PC never to synchronize even in very low
transfer rates, if the initial speed is too high. Or the program may
show frequent 'Synchronization Lost' messages or things like that.
Try lowering the initial speed and see if every thing works all right.
It is best to find a suitable speed by trial and error.

 Note that you may not be able to use high transfer rates because of the
low speed of the Amiga or the PC. On an A1200 with fast ram and an IBM 
386DX 40MHz, with cache, 57600 pbs works fine. As The hardware of the PC 
serial port can be used, while the Amiga Serial port is accessed only by its
software drivers, the real limitation is caused by the Amiga.   

 The delay time is computed in seconds. The number you enter in configuration
window is used on the server. The Amiga adds 2 seconds to that to make sure
the two machines will synch. On both machines, an amount equal to the actual
transfer time of the data is added to this. Delay time can not be zero.
The main use of it is when dealing with slow devices.

 You can save the configuraion of your choice. The configuration file
is S:EasyTransfer.Config.

 When the configuration is OK, press the CONNECT gadget. If every thing goes
all right, the connection is established. Use the string gadget at the top
left of the screen to enter PC directories, and the string gadget at the
top right for Amiga. Enter the directory name and press return to change
directory there and also see the directory contents. Double clicking on a
directory name will cause the program to enter it. Press on PARENT to leave
the directory, but do not use it while in the root directory of a disk. Press
DELETE to delete a file or directory or MKDIR to create a new directory. 
At any time, one of the Amiga or PC windows is active and the operations
mentioned above applies to it. the active window is marked by being 'carved' 
in the screen. The inactive one pops up.

 You can select files or directories to transfer by clicking the mouse on
them. If the Amiga window is active, the CONNECT gadget will become SEND
and if the PC window is active, it becomes RECEIVE. The CONFIG gadget 
will turn into BINARY or TEXT, showing if a translation of files will take
place (more on this later).

 Selecting a directory, causes all the files and directories inside it also 
to be sent recursively. After a transfer, the program updates the 
corresponding window by getting the new directory contents. 

 If TEXT option is chosen during a transfer, files comming from the server
are searched for carriage returns and Control-Z characters. The files going 
to the server are augmented with a carriage return whenever a linefeed is
seen. When BINARY option is chosen, files won't change.

 The amount of transfered data is shown graphically in TELECOMMUNICATIONS
subwindow. This is reserved for file transfers.

 You can cancel a transfer by hitting the ESCAPE key. If the program tries 
to read a directory after cancelling a transfer, it may fail. Just wait a 
few seconds and try again.

 Beware of long file names on the Amiga. Long file names will be truncated
on the PC side. For example, if you send longfilename1 and longfilename2
to the same directory of the PC, the last one will overwrite the first one.
To prevent this from happening, use the gadget in the left of TEXT/BINARY
gadget. When it shows PROTECT, the program will prevent overwrites on files
already existing in the Amiga or PC directory. The OVR WRT is a sign that
the program will not care about overwrites.

The program changes a starting '.' (like in .info) to '_'.

 Pressing EXIT will end the program, but befor that, the Amiga tries to 
inform the server of the quit and the server will also quit.



 Be careful with wiring and turn off both computers befor connecting a 
cable
