   -------
   This is my latest work, since i gave up cracking in January 1994
   i have been able to sort out my life and i am off to college in a 
   week or so, because of the nature of my course i need to buy an 
   IBM compatible PC, the amiga im afraid is to be sold to pay for
   a 486 DX2/66.

   This program has been sitting on my hardrive for a while, i HAVE
   to release it in its BETA form, or it will never get released at
   all, i may be able to afford to buy another amiga in a year or two
   but college is my main priority.

   Enjoy this program, and feel free to update it, but please remember
   to at least credit me for my work on it, after all it will be my 
   last Amiga project for a while, in fact i may never return to the
   Amiga, who knows?


   To my friends in the amiga scene, and to all the crews i have cracked
   (deprotected) software for:
 
     FAIRLIGHT,MINISTRY,QUARTEX,CRYSTAL,DEFJAM & ANGELS,GENESIS,SCOOPEX

   Thankyou.

                             ----------
             - About The Ultimate Degrader & Enhancer -

 TUDE has been in development for a few months, i needed a degrader
type program that offered more flexibility than any of the currently 
available programs (Relokick, my own RunIt, Degrader, Runlame etc.),
in one easy to use package. So TUDE was born.

Two versions of TUDE are included, a CLI version and a GUI version.

                             ----------
                  - TUDES options and their uses -


TUDEGUI is a Gadget User Interface version of TUDE
TUDE    is the CLI version of tude

NOTE: TUDE must be in your C: directory for the TUDEGUI to work.
      The kickstart 1.3 file (kick34005.a500) must be in your SYS:
      directory or in DEVS:KICKSTARTS


HELP
----
Option type: 
--------------
This option will display simple instructions for each of the options
available in TUDE, a more detailed explanation for each option is
contained in these docs.



PRIVILEGED
----------
Option type: PATCH
------------------
Since the 68010, certain CPU instructions must be run in supervisor
mode or they will cause what is know as a privileged error.
This option intercepts the error and executes the instruction as
the 68000 would. 

If the software you are using continually crashes with error 80000008
or just crashes for no reason, try this option.



MMURESET
--------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
If you have a 68851 or a full 680x0 CPU i.e. not the EC version, it
will have some special hardware called a Memory Management Unit, this
allows the user to remap areas of memory to another address, write
protect memory and other useful options.
This option resets the MMU to its default values so that the memory
is in its original bootup state. NOTE: If you are using the MMU to
remap kickstart to fast memory, this option will crash your machine
( for obvious reasons ! ).

There is no real way of detecting if the MMU is to blame for your
softwares failure, just try the option.



BLANKVIEW
---------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option resets the display to a blank ECS type screen, it will
stay in this state until the software opens its own.

Since the release of kickstart 3 and the AGA chipset, many programs
suffer a corrupt screen problem when run from HardDrive or Workbench.
This will cure the problem 90% of the time, however use of the CHIPSET
or FMODE options in conjunction with BLANKVIEW will cure the remaining
10%.



OSPATCHOLD
----------
Option Type: PATCH
------------------
This option patches certain library vectors to return OS1.3 values
without the need to kickup in kickstart 1.3

Some software relies heavily on the values being returned by the OS
to be the same as kickstart 1.3, a perfect example of return value
differences is in kickstart 2.0+'s memory routines. If the software
fails due to memory problems or just fails for no reason, try this
option



NOFASTMEMORY
------------
Option Type: PATCH
------------------
This option allocates all the fast memory it can, and patches the OS
so that any programs that allocate memory only get chipram.

Some programs will not run with fast memory, especially if run on
A4000/A3000 and CD32's. In the majority of cases, no error will be
given the software will just crash, just try this option if others fail.



HARDRESET
---------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option Resets the CPU - all attached peripherals & Execbase, your machine will be in the same state as it was when you first powered on.

If after running some software, your machine behaves weird, use this
option, saves you having to power off all the time!
As a side effect, it kills all known viruses DEAD



KICKSTART1.3
------------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option will "kickdown" your machine to kickstart 1.3 with ANY
of TUDES available options i.e. PRIVILEGED, CHIPMEM=512k, NOFASTMEMORY
etc. This makes it a VERY powerful option.

KICKSTART1.3 DEGRADE will be one of your most used options, if software
is going to work without alteration, this will probably do it!



MEMTOP
------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option affects all TUDES PATCH options, it forces them to take
their memory from the top of the memory list.
NOTE: Kickstart 2.0 or above needed.

Even though programs can be fixed with TUDES options, sometimes
the patches will be overwritten if in lower memory, this stops that
happening by placing them high up in the available memory.



MEMCHIP
-------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option affects all TUDES PATCH options, it forces them to take
their memory from ChipRam. MEMTOP & MEMCHIP can be mixed.
NOTE: Kickstart 2.0 or above needed.

Even though programs can be fixed with TUDES options, sometimes
the patches will be overwritten if in FAST memory, this stops that
happening by placing them in ChipRam.



DEGRADE
-------
Option Type: Run Once
----------------------
This option checks the machine it is running on and selects what it
thinks are the best options to degrade the machine as much as possible.

If you have not got a clue why software fails, try this option.



ENHANCE
-------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option checks the machine it is running on and selects what it
thinks are the best options to enhance the machine as much as possible.

If you want to turn on all the available power in your machine, this
is for you!



OPTFILE=<filename>
------------------
Option Type: Run Once
----------------------
This option reads in an ASCII textfile and passes it as commands for
TUDE to execute.

If you are a cli user, once you have found out what makes a particular
piece of software run, create a textfile with the options needed
and just use it with TUDE via this option.
Saves all that retyping!



FAKEFAST=[1|2|3]
----------------
Option type: Run Once
---------------------
This option gives chipram only machines fast memory by fooling the OS
into thinking that any chipram above a certain address is fastmemory.
The amount of fake fast depends on the number after the FAKEFAST
command word.

FAKEFAST=1 gives 1meg+ chipram machines 512k  chip & rest of ram is fast
FAKEFAST=2 gives 2meg  chipram machines 1024k chip & rest of ram is fast
FAKEFAST=1 gives 2meg  chipram machines 1536k chip & rest of ram is fast

It can also be used before the KICKSTART1.3 option is called to give
you fakefast memory AFTER kicking up.

Its usage is varied, it will obviously help in nofastram errors, but can
also help older software that relies on certain chipram address's being
free, by relocating execbase into fakefast.



CHIPSET=[OLD|ECS|AGA|BEST]
--------------------------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option will emulate the specified chipset if the hardware will
allow. Currently AGA can emulate the OLD and ECS chipsets, and ECS 
can emulate the OLD chipset.
CHIPSET=OLD  On AGA/ECS machines the original chipset will be emulated
CHIPSET=ECS  On AGA/ECS machines the enhanced chipset will be emulated
CHIPSET=AGA  On AGA/ECS machines the AGA chipset will be selected
CHIPSET=BEST The chipsets best features will be enabled.

NOTE: Unlike other degraders such as RunIt, TUDE's chipset option
      still works AFTER the Workbench 3 setpatch command has been run.
      TUDE's chipset option will affect ALL newly opened screens,              currently opened screens retain their chipset values.

It can be used to stop corrupt graphics on AGA/ECS machines, or to turn
on AGA features for older software.

BOOT=[LOWCHIP|HIGHCHIP|LOWFAST|HIGHFAST]
----------------------------------------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option allows the user to "bootup" a disk in the internal drive
with any of TUDE's options. The type of memory that the bootblock is
read into can also be altered.

BOOT=LOWCHIP   Read bootblock into lowchip  memory and boot disk
BOOT=HIGHCHIP  Read bootblock into highchip memory and boot disk
BOOT=LOWFAST   Read bootblock into lowfast  memory and boot disk
BOOT=HIGHFAST  Read bootblock into highfast memory and boot disk

REMEMBER: Any of TUDE's options can be used before booting up disk.

Apart from using this to boot up a disk with TUDE's options,
some software expects the bootblock to be either in chipram, or for 
certain areas of memory to be free and unused by the OS, obviously
if a bootblock reads data over its own code, or over the OS libraries
it will cause a software failure.



FMODE=[1x|2x|3x|4x]
-------------------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option alters the AGA chipsets fetchrate from chipram, for the 
higher fetchrates data must be aligned to 64bit boundaries, lower
fetchrates allow data to be on 16bit boundaries.

FMODE=1x  Set AGA graphics fetchrate to OLD & ECS values
FMODE=2x  Set AGA graphics fetchrate to 32bits
FMODE=3x  Set AGA graphics fetchrate to 32bits +
FMODE=4x  Set AGA graphics fetchrate to 64bits

NOTE: Although other degraders such as RunIt & Embedder have this 
      option, theirs will only alter the fetchmode while the
      screen is blanked, TUDE's fmode option will affect ALL
      newly opened screens, currently opened screens retain
      their fetchmode values.

The fetchmode can cause havoc with certain software, all you see is
garbage on the screen or corrupt sprites, use the FMODE=1x option
to reset the fetchmode for all NEWLY opened screens to OLD/ECS rates.

You could also use it with older software to help speed up GFX, use
the FMODE=2x to FMODE=4x options

See Also: BLANKVIEW



VIEW=[VGA|PRODUCT|DBLPAL|DBLNTSC]
---------------------------------
Option type: PATCH
------------------
This option forces all screens that are opened via the OS to use a
certain monitor type, in kickstart 3.0 the actual monitor driver
MUST be in DEVS:

VIEW=VGA      Force all screens opened via the OS to use VGA
VIEW=PRODUCT  Force all screens opened via the OS to use PRODUCTIVITY 
VIEW=DBLPAL   Force all screens opened via the OS to use DBLPAL 
VIEW=DBLNTSC  Force all screens opened via the OS to use DBLNTSC

If you are using a VGA monitor or the software you are using does
not support the screen mode you want, use this option.



HERTZ=[HWPAL|HWNTSC|OSPAL|OSNTSC|PAL|NTSC]
------------------------------------------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option will force the display and/or OS to function as if it
were an NTSC or PAL machine.

HERTZ=HWPAL   Go into PAL  mode via ECS/AGA chipset
HERTZ=HWNTSC  Go into NTSC mode via ECS/AGA chipset
HERTZ=OSPAL   Patch OS to think it is a pal machine   
HERTZ=OSNTSC  Patch OS to think it is a ntsc machine
HERTZ=PAL     Patch OS and go into pal  via the ECS/AGA chipset
HERTZ=NTSC    Patch OS and go into ntsc via the ECS/AGA chipset

This has various uses, from making software intended for PAL use to 
work on NTSC machines ( and NTSC software on PAL machines), to making
software run faster and use the full screen vertically.



VBASE=[ZERO|FAST]
-----------------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
Since the 68010, the vector locations for interrupts and exceptions
can be moved to any location in chip or fast ram, this option will
either reset them to the 68000 location, or move them to fast ram.

VBASE=ZERO  Set vector locations to zero  ( 68000 )
VBASE=FAST  Set vectors locations to Fast ram

The VBASE=ZERO option will fix most software ran from HD on 68040
based machines such as the A4000, if software has no music or display
does not seem to update correctly, try this option.

The VBASE=FAST option can be used to speed up software, but only
if you have true fast ram, and the software will run correctly with
the vector base altered.



FILTER=[OFF|ON]
---------------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option enables the user to turn the lowpass audio filter on and
off, both have their advantages.

FILTER=OFF   Turn off the lowpass audio filter for clearer sound
FILTER=ON    Turn on  the lowpass audio filter to stop distortion

You can use this option to makes sounds sharper and clearer in your
games software, or to help stop distortion on gritty samples.



CHIPMEM=[512k|1024k]
--------------------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option reduces chip ram to specified values.

CHIPMEM=512k  Reduce chipram to 512k
CHIPMEM=1024k Reduce chipram to 1024k

Older software, especially games, will crash when more than 512k of
chipram is available, there are no tell tale signs, just try it!



CACHES=[NONE|ALL|NOINS|NODATA|INSON|DATAON]
-------------------------------------------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option manipulates the cache memory on the 68020+, data caches can
only be altered on the 68030+.

CACHES=NONE   : Turn off all CPU caches on 68020+
CACHES=ALL    : Turn on  all CPU caches on 68020+
CACHES=NOINS  : Turn off CPU instruction cache on 68020+
CACHES=NODATA : Turn off CPU data cache on 68030
CACHES=INSON  : Turn on  CPU instruction cache on 68020+
CACHES=DATA   : Turn on  CPU data cache on 68030+

The CPU caches cause a lot of problems on older software, self altering
code, CPU delay loops, all fail on 68020+, turning off the caches helps
this software to run correctly.

To make software run faster, turn on the caches, remember the data cache
is not enabled on 68030/40 A4000 until the setpatch command has run.



BORDER=[NORM|BLANK]
-------------------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This option will allow the genlocking of AGA to be turned on or off.
A side affect of using this option without genlock data coming in, is
a completely black border with does improve contrast!

BORDER=NORM   : Border area is in normal OCS/ECS state",$a
BORDER=BLANK  : Border area is in Blank/genlock state",$a	

If the video software you are using fails to work in genlock mode
correctly, use the BORDER=BLANK option, if the genlock interfere's
with software that it should not, use the BORDER=NORM option.



SPRITE=[OCS|ECS|70NS|35NS|DEF]
------------------------------
Option Type: Run Once
---------------------
This options alters the resolution of the amiga's hardware sprites.

SPRITE=OCS    : Reset Sprite resolution to OCS state",$a
SPRITE=ECS    : Reset Sprite resolution to ECS multistate",$a
SPRITE=70NS   : Reset AGA/ECS Sprites to HIRES resoltion",$a
SPRITE=35NS   : Reset AGA/ECS Sprites to SHIRES resoltion",$a
SPRITE=DEF    : Reset AGA/ECS Sprites to default WB value",$a

If you have corrupt sprites, or they are too small/big for the screen
they are on, using one of these options will correct the fault.
