You don't have to pay anything,  but  presents  or  registrations  for
HTMLtext.mcc are always welcome.


INTRODUCTION
************

You may use the tool "moreHTML" to display your  hypertext  documents,
if you prefer to write them in HTML instead of AmigaGuide®.


NOTE
****

The sourcecode of the browser comes with this distribution, because it
is also an example of how to use the HTMLtext.mcc in own applications.
I hope that this way some able people will help me to make it a better
browser.


FEATURES
********
- A big set of HTML tags is supported
- Saving, printing, clipboard, search, ARexx port, configurable
- Text is markable
- Documentation written in HTML
- Under GNU License
