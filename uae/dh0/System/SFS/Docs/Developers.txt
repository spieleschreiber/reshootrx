Developer documentation is not included in this archive.
You can find on-line developer documentation at:

  http://www.xs4all.nl/~hjohn/SFS


There however is a Include directory in the archive which
contains C header files.  The header files are mainly there
to give you an idea of how SFS is structured internally,
although with a bit of tweaking they should be useable for
development as well.

There will be more support later on -- this is the best I
could do on my own for now.
