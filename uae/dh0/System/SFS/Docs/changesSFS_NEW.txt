---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.277 (10.11.2007)
- Removed 30 char limit for volume names.
- Fixed a bug in ACTION_EXAMINE_ALL.
- OS4: Rebuild with GCC 4.2.2.

1.276 (8.9.2007)
- AmigaOS 3.x: Fixed a bug formatting SFS\0 partitions.
- AmigaOS 3.x: Now pretents to be FFS in ACTION_DISK_INFO and
  ACTION_INFO for SFS\2 partitions as well.

1.275 (29.8.2007)
- Built for AmigaOS 3.x/m68k incl. 'SFS/2' support.
  To use 'SFS/2' partitions on AmigaOS 3.x you have to install
  SmartFileSystem into the RDB with DOSType 'SFS/2' (0x53465302), i.e.
  to use both 'SFS\0' and 'SFS\2' partitions you have to install the
  same SmartFileSystem binary 2 times into the RDB.
  If booting from 'SFS\2' partitions isn't required you can load
  SmartFileSystem as kickstart module using tools like LoadResident,
  LoadModule, etc. instead of storing it twice in the RDB.

1.274 (17.8.2007)
- OS4: Removed support for AmigaOS4 versions older than OS4 final.
- Added a new format with large file support, to use it select DOSType
  'SFS\2' (0x53465302) for the partitions.
  WARNING: It's not compatible to the older SFS2 versions, nor to
           standard SFS partitions (DOSType 'SFS\0', 0x53465300) and
           therefore tools like SFSCheck, PartitionWizard, etc. don't
           work on such partitions and you can't use such a partition
           for booting from U-Boot/SLB!

1.273 (24.7.2007)
- Fixed a bug in ACTION_WRITE writing to large files.
- Added workarounds for bugs in MorphOS, the AmigaOS 3.x/m68k version
  should work on it again.

1.272 (13.7.2007)
- OS4: Speed up detection of unreadable CD/DVD.

1.271 (11.7.2007)
- Fixed de_Control check.

1.270 (17.4.2007)
- OS4: Removed the requesters with timeouts for successfull operations
  since they can't be read on most systems anyway because they are
  displayed before Picasso96, etc. is loaded, and before IPrefs was
  started.

1.269 (3.4.2007)
- Forgot to disable some debug output in 1.268, fixed.

1.268 (29.3.2007)
- OS4: Requesters don't use TimedDosRequester() anymore since the new
  SYS:Prefs/Presets/Requester feature of requester.class could cause
  deadlocks.
- Changed some memory allocations to MEMF_PUBLIC/MEMF_SHARED.

1.267 (10.12.2006)
- OS4: Now checks the free stack size and uses the old file system API
  if it's low.

1.266 (08.12.2006)
- ACTION_EXAMINE_ALL now returns ERROR_NO_FREE_STORE if there isn't
  even enough space for a single entry in the buffer.
- ACTION_EXAMINE_ALL now returns ERROR_OBJECT_WRONG_TYPE if someone
  tries to use it again after directory scanning was complete already
  (implicitely or by using ACTION_EXAMINE_ALL_END).
- Fixed wrong error return code for ACTION_READ_LINKS.
- OS4: Now uses IExec->CopyMem() instead of a custom memcpy().

1.265 (17.11.2006)
- Fixed a bug in the AmigaOS 3.x/m68k version.

1.264 (15.11.2006)
- Didn't check for too long targets when creating soft links, fixed.

1.263/m68k (13.10.2006)
- Removes AmigaOS4-only memory types from de_BufMemType if not running
  on OS4, that way partitions configured to use an OS4-only memory type
  like MEMF_PRIVATE can be mounted on AmigaOS 3.x as well.

1.263 (3.10.2006)
- Removable media support was broken in 1.262, fixed.

1.262 (30.9.2006)
- Changed the "wrong number of free blocks" requester to a timeout
  requester.
- Fixed a bug which could cause a crash if a SFS partition is mounted
  after the Workbench is running already.

1.261 (11.8.2006)
- OS4: Enabled speedups for AmigaOS4 Update4 users.
- OS4: No longer allows asynchronous ExNext(), small reads and writes.
- OS4: Dropped the IExpansion interface once too much, fixed.
- 32 bit Seek() and SetFileSize() with OFFSET_BEGINNING work up to
  4 GB - 2 bytes now.
- OS4: A struct Node was in .rodata, fixed.
- OS4: Speed up SFS CD/DVD detection.
- Added ACTION_WAIT_CHAR and ACTION_WAIT_FOR_DATA.

1.255 (10.3.2006)
- OS4: DVD+RW and DVD-RAM workarounds for MATSHITA DVD-RAM UJ-845S
  added.

1.254 (4.3.2006)
- The limits mentioned in the 1.245 notes were wrong, sorry. The actual
  partition size limit of SFS 1.x is 128 GB, no matter which blocksize
  you are using. Changed the checks to the actual limits. You can
  continue to use too large partitions, but you may get "disk full"
  errors (instead of a trashed partition) even if there is still free
  space on the partition.

1.253 (14.2.2006)
- OS4: No longer opens diskcache.library when used on CD/DVDRW.
- OS4: Changed results of ACTION_CHANGE_FILE_POSITION64 and
       ACTION_CHANGE_FILE_SIZE64 to the ones the Update4 dos.library
       expects.
- ACTION_CHANGE_FILE_SIZE64 and ACTION_SET_FILE_SIZE no longer change
  the file size to a, for the caller, random size if other files are
  open with a current offset after the requested size, now you either
  get the requested size and success, or an error and the old file size
  isn't changed. (Yes, this is against the documentation of dos.library
  SetFileSize(), but changing the file size to something else makes no
  sense at all to me.)
- OS4: diskcache.library copy-back mode is now enabled by default and
       can be en-/disabled with ACTION_SET_CACHE, for example using the
       SFS "SetCache" tool.

1.252 (7.1.2006)
- m68k: Fixed an alignment bug in the 64 bit packet support.
- Added some checks in ACTION_SEEK, ACTION_CHANGE_FILE_POSITION64,
  ACTION_SET_FILE_SIZE, ACTION_CHANGE_FILE_SIZE64, ACTIION_READ and
  ACTION_WRITE to make sure you can't create/access files > 4 GB - 2
  bytes.
