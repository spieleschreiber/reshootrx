SFSformat can be used to quick format an SFS partition.

Once more:
SFSformat can be used ONLY to QUICK format an SFS partition.

Use AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 or HDInstTools6.9 for partitions larger
than 4GB or located (/partially) beyond 4GB.

For 'full format' use Format from WB 3.5/3.9 (NSD) or
HDInstTools6.9 (NSD/TD64).

The normal format command has special options for FastFilesystem
(FFS Intl., DIRCACHE and so on) -- SFSformat (NSD and TD64) has
special options for Smart Filesystem.

It's command line syntax is:

 DEVICE=DRIVE/A/K,NAME/K/A,CASESENSITIVE/S,NORECYCLED/S,
 SHOWRECYCLED/S


DEVICE or DRIVE

The SFS drive you wish to quick format.  SFSformat can only
be used to quick format an SFS drive.  Other filesystems
will be unaffected.


NAME

The name of the newly formatted partition.  


CASESENSITIVE

Specify this on the command line to get case sensitive file
and directory names (ala UNIX).  If you specify this option,
then SFS will treat the files 'foo', 'Foo', 'FOO', 'fOo', 'foO',
and 'FoO as distinct files!! Without this option they would
be treated as one and the same file (FFS behaviour).


NORECYCLED

When specified the disk will be formatted WITHOUT creating a
Recycled directory.  You can't create this directory later
on (atleast not for now), so choose carefully.


SHOWRECYCLED

By default the Recycled directory is hidden and won't show
up in directory listings.  You can override this behaviour
with this switch.


When starting SFSformat it will ask you to confirm the
format.  Press Return to format, or Ctrl + C to abort.


Examples
--------

SFSformat drive SFS: name Empty casesensitive

-> Quick formats drive SFS: and gives it the name 'Empty'.
   File and directory names on this drive will be case
   sensitive.


SFSformat drive HD0: name MyDrive

-> Quick formats drive HD0: and gives it the name 'MyDrive'.
   File and directory names on this drive will be treated
   case insensitively (like under FFS).
