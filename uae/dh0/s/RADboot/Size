/* Recoverable RAM disk mount entry
 *
 * You can create different simultaneous recoverable RAM disks by creating
 * versions of this file with different Unit values.
 *
 * The size of a recoverable RAM disk is controlled by the value of the
 * HighCyl line. Increasing this value by 1 consumes an additional 11K of
 * RAM. So the default value of 79 consumes around 880 of memory.
