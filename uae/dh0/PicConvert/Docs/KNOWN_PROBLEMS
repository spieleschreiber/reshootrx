KNOWN PROBLEMS:

· If you are using the original PIPE: handler, you should set IOBUF in PBMMEM
  to 4K or less.  There is a bug in PIPE: that causes it to drop bytes if the
  write request is larger than its internal buffer. A replacement
  queue-handler (the handler used by PIPE:) was written by Heinz Wrobel, it
  is included in the extras directory.

· There is a bug in mathieeesingbas.library that might cause NetPBM to crash
  on 68040. Please use SetPatch V43 (in the extras directory) to fix this
  problem.
